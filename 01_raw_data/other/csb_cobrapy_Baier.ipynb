Further, when each nutrient is individually removed, some may appear essential as their absence alone halts the growth.

Since metabolic networks often have multiple pathways to achieve growth, there may be several valid combinations of nutrients that support growth."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"26365599-01bb-4abe-a6e3-5b78f73defa0","metadata":{"id":"26365599-01bb-4abe-a6e3-5b78f73defa0"},"source":["# Task 1.2 (7 points)\n","**Implement Strategy B:**\n","* Enable all uptakes, switch one off and check if growth is possible.\n","* If growth is still possible, remove the next one, otherwise switch it back on\n","and then remove the next one\n","* Repeat until all uptakes were tested\n","\n","**Questions to be answered:**\n","* Does it guarantee a valid growth medium?\n","* Does it guarantee a medium with a minimal number\n","of components?\n","* Is the result necessarily unique?
